# Grocery-List
Users can edit their grocery list.
After opening the script the user will see a menu appear with multiple options.
In order to select one of the options, they will enter the number of the choice they would like to make.
Depending on their choice, they may be asked to put more information in.
For example, if they select that they would like to add an item, they will then need to type in the name of the item they want to add to the list.
After the program makes the requested changes to the list, the updated list will print and the user will be asked to continue.
They can either respond yes or no, and if yes, the options will be printed again. Answering no will quit the program.
I also worked with Audrey Young.
